# BASS audio library binding for Red/System

Purpose of the file [bass.reds](Bass/bass.reds) is to provide low level access to [BASS Audio API](http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html) functions from Red/System.

So far there is just simple Red/System test script [bass-test.reds](Bass/bass-test.reds)

This Binding was created using semi-automatic script, so not everything is guaranteed to work. Also I never used BASS API yet, so 
this is a new playground for me (Oldes).

So far there is support only for Windows. Tested with version 2.4.12.
