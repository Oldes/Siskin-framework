# FMOD Studio API binding for Red/System

Purpose of the file [FMOD.reds](FMOD/FMOD.reds) is to provide low level access to [FMOD Studio API](http://www.fmod.com/api) functions from Red/System.


So far there is just simple Red/System test script [FMOD-test.reds](FMOD/FMOD-test.reds)

This Binding was created using semi-automatic script, so not everything is guaranteed to work. Also I never used FMOD API yet, so 
this is a new playground for me (Oldes).

So far there is support only for Windows with **FMOD Studio API** version 1.09.01, which may be downloaded here http://www.fmod.org/download/#StudioAPI (requires registration)
